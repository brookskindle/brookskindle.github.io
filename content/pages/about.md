Title: About

## Hi there üëãüèª
I'm Brooks, thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something
useful in this digital garden of mine. This site is primarily an outlet for
journaling my thoughts and experiences on topics that I enjoy or find
important.

About me. I enjoy building things, solving real world problems, and helping
people. In the professional world, you will most likely find me
at the intersection of those three, writing software and mentoring teammates.
My LinkedIn profile has more official information
about my employment history, but briefly: I most commonly work with
Python/JavaScript/SQL, have experience developing cloud-based full-stack
applications, find particular enjoyment in solving data engineering problems,
and love using the command line.

If I'm not at my day job, there's a good chance I'm still at my computer
working on a side project or reading up about a new technology. This is
balanced, however, with several outside hobbies. I consider myself a decent
juggler, a fair weather bicyclist, and have recently gotten into camping as a
way to disconnect and recharge from the digital world.

## My Values
If I had a personal manifesto, it would read like so:

**Stay curious and never stop exploring.** The world is vast, and there is
great joy in discovering for yourself what it has to offer.

**Embrace Vulnerability.** To err is human, and I find the more often I open
myself up and admit my shortcomings, the more often I can connect with people
in a meaningful way and give/receive help where it is needed.

**Be financially responsible.** Money makes the world go 'round, yet for most
people (myself included), it is a finite resource which takes a significant
amount of time and energy to obtain. Some studies estimate one third of your
life will be spent working. For such a large percentage, you owe it to yourself
to spend prudently and avoid trading away the fruits of your labor for things
that, on the whole, do not contribute to your overall happiness or well-being.
