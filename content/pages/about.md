Title: About

### Who I am
My name is Brooks Kindle, and I live in Seattle, WA.

### My work
I work on internal productivity tools at Dell EMC, with a focus on increasing
engineering velocity, enabling data-driven decisions, and improving product
quality.

I've architected technical solutions to problems both individually and as part
of a team, and because business needs so often vary from project to project,
I've also gained a high level of expertise in full stack web development, data
engineering, command line tools, and more.
