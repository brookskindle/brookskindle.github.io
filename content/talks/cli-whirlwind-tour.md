# My command line
A whirlwind tour of useful command-line tools and features that I use

# Why the command line?

* All developers have to use it
* Might as well be productive in it
* It can be fun (no, really)

???

There will be some repeats from part 1, but only those that I still find useful

# environment variables, $PATH, $OLDCWD
# shell: stdin/stdout/stderr (0, 1, 2), redirects, here strings, pipes, everything is a file
# shell aliases
# brew (specifically, services)
# psql, createdb, dropdb, pg_dump
# ctrl + w to delete part of a word
# tmux (or simply iterm tabs/windows)
# yabai
# visidata (data: stores.json, zipcodes, employees list)
# docker
# k8s (esp. autocomplete), minikube
# openssl / create a cert
# pup
# CLI makes repeatability and discoverability a breeze
# curl/httpie
# jq
# man
# aws && aws-okta
# serve / python3 -m http.server
# ipython
# bat
# pbcopy/pbpaste
# redis-cli / redis-server
