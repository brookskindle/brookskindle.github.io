Title: Embracing Javascript

I have a confession to make; I don't know javascript all that well. As a
developer whose strengths lie primarily in back-end work, I've always held the
language at arms' length, relying on it only when absolutely necessary. All
that is about to change, because I am finally embracing javascript. Initially,
my plan is to write in Node.js, and then move on to more front-end work
afterwards. As node is server-side javascript, this will allow me to leverage
all my years as a back-end developer and allow me to anchor new concepts to my
existing experience, hopefully providing a more fun way of learning, while
simultaneously increasing my retention of new concepts.

What do I plan to learn about? All the things! I sketched out a list of topics
I'm interested in learning, outlined below.

* how to document node code?
* can I type hint with node?
* how does error handling work?
* what tools exist for linting?
* what's the standard way of debugging node code?
* learning interactively with a REPL
* what best practices and tools are there for logging?
* how to structure larger node projects?
* how does importing work?
* when to use promises/async and when to use callbacks
* how does testing work? Specifically, mocking and coverage?
* what does node packaging look like, and what tools/commands are useful?
* how do I package my own code?
* what are the basic data types, functions, and objects common in node?
* can node code be run in the browser?
* how can I set up my environment to get autocompletion/suggestions?
* what useful tools exist in the node ecosystem? node, npm, npx, etc..
* how does parsing command line arguments work?

They're in no particular order, but in rough swaths, are all aimed at making me
a better, more rounded developer. As is consistent with the way I tend to learn
things, I probably will pick topics randomly as the mood strikes, as opposed to
a more formal and concrete structuring of topics. If you're curious to follow
along with me, or just check in every once in a while, I hope to make a series
of posts here documenting the things that I've learned. Partly for self
reference and partly to help others on a similar journey.
