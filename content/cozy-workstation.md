Summary: or: hygge, and why I spend so much time theming my computer

Let me cut to the chase: I work in software and have a number of digital
hobbies. As a result, much of my time is spent in front of a computer. You may
remember from my post on [installing Arch Linux]({filename}/arch-install.md)
that I'm no stranger to configuration. I configure a lot of things about my
system. I tweak. I fiddle with the software knobs until something works just
how I want it to. And I enjoy it.

You may write this craze for configuration off as an obsession, or as a need to
have control over my environment - to an extent you are probably right.

But there is something else about it, too. I know that my computer is unique.
The desktop environment, the keyboard shortcuts, all the carefully chosen
status bar colors and background wallpapers comprise an experience that is
unique to me and my system. That uniqueness is special, and it lends itself to
a level of coziness -- hygge, to use the term my coworker likes to use --
whenever I am on it.

That's all. I mostly wrote this post because at half past midnight yesterday, I
took a screenshot of my desktop while working on another post, and wanted to
share it.

What's in the picture? This is an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
setup, running the [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) tiling window
manager, [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for editing,
[Pianobar](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar) for music, and a wallpaper I
created based on a Legend of Zelda fanart by
[nikiforcvs](https://twitter.com/nikiforcvs/status/1332374240536870912). The
editor and terminal colors are based on the
[Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme.

Shameless plug: If you want to borrow some of my settings, you can find the
configuration in my dotfiles repository:
