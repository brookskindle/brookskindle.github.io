I attended my first JavaScript conference,
[CascadiaJS](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/), this year. It was an amazing
experience and, if given the chance, I will definitely attend the next one. For
future reference, here are the [speakers](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/speakers)
and the [talks they gave](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/schedule).

## Highlights
* [Jim Liu](https://twitter.com/jimcalliu), for volunteering his time to
  organize, **and** for gifting our entire engineering team with tickets so
  that we could attend as a group.

* How welcoming and supportive the entire CascadiaJS community is.

* [The Pac-Man
  Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/#the-pac-man-rule),
  leave space for others to join in. á—§

* Despite being a virtual event, feeling completely engaged and connected the
  whole time. Having a live slack space and [live chat
  tables](https://remo.co/) for the duration of the conference brought us all
  together even though physically distant.

* Talks highlighting the importance of mental health & taking care of yourself.

* [The Operating System of
  You](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/operating-system-of-you). Habits > anything
  else; it's not about discipline, but setting up your environment to make the
  good thing the default.

* Talks focusing on [web
  accessibility](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#blogs) -- I know
  nothing about this space.

* JavaScript has a stack & heap memory concept too. Chrome and Firefox
  developer tools have heap diffing/visualization for debugging purposes.

* ["Data is considered to be at risk unless \[you have\] a dedicated plan to
  not be at
  risk"](https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2020-010/)

* [Digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)

* [A 3D game created with a CSS-only graphics
  engine](https://pantel.is/projects/css3d/)

* [melody.dev](https://melody.dev/), I love the look of this personal site

* [pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool/), a data-driven journalism site

Despite being virtual, we still managed to take a group photo.
