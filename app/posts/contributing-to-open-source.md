title: Contributing to open source

## successful = OpenSource.contribute()
Contributing to open source projects has always been a dream of mine but
something that I was never able to fully commit to.

## if not successful:

My first attempt at contributing to open source software was with tmux, a
terminal multiplexer written in C. I contacted the project maintainer and asked
if my feature idea was useful and if he had any getting started tips for me. He
gave me his blessing as well as some really solid advice on how to implement my
idea. I was an avid user of tmux and knew my way around the program pretty well
 -- what could possibly go wrong?

To make a long story short, I failed miserably after trying a variety of
different approaches. None ended up going very far. Looking back, there were
several reasons for this.

* I was trying to implement a *huge* feature in a project that I had never
  worked with before.
* I had little to no experience working with large projects.
* I did not have a compelling reason to work on this feature.

Despite being fairly proficient in the C language (C and C++ were the languages
of choice for most of my schooling), I found myself struggling with this
self-inflicted assignment. This brings me to my next point.

* I asked for permission

Asking for permission is a great thing to do and in most cases will improve the
likelyhood of a change being accepted. The tradeoff, however, is that you feel
obligated to work on and finish what has been started. In my case, this made
matters worse.

## else:  # success case

This past week I made a relatively small contribution to the open source python
library, setuptools. For those who are unfamiliar, setuptools is a python
library designed to make packaging and distributing python projects easy. It is
built on top of its predecessor library, distutils.

It was the "Hello, world!" of open source contributions and while its
functional significance might barely be realized or acknowledged, the purpose
of "Hello, world!" projects are not to demonstrate the full capabilities of a
language or library, but rather to demonstrate to the creator how easy it is to
get started.

I had much more success contributing to this project than I did with tmux and
I've had time to think about and reflect why this is.

* I had a very specific and small feature I wanted to implement.
* Unlike tmux, this project was much smaller and I was a lot more comfortable
  with the code base despite not having touched it before.
* I had a vested interest in the feature I was implementing

Lastly, I did not ask for permission, which was a huge relief stress-wise
because it left me free to work on it on my own time without feeling like I'm
letting anybody down.

## Advice
My advice for someone who is looking to contribute to open source is to start
small. Pick a project that you use, enjoy, and are relatively familiar with and
focus on making a small change that would benefit you. Don't feel like you need
to get it done immediately -- go your own pace. Don't ask for permission
to implement it, but do ask for advice/help if you need it.
